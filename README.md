# üìö Academic Notes by Albert Xu

Welcome! This page contains selected summaries, notes, and conceptual sketches from my coursework and self-study in mathematics and physics.

## üß† Philosophy

Most of my notes are handwritten, since I value the speed and intuition that comes with writing during lectures or reading.  
However, I am gradually organizing and digitizing select topics that are either central to my study or particularly beautiful.

This repository will grow over time.

## üßë‚Äçüéì About

These notes come from my studies at Rice University and my independent reading.  
Where possible, I try to capture both rigor and intuition.
